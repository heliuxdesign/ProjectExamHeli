    <h1>SpaceX - Space technology</h1>
    <P id="musk">“You want to wake up in the morning and think the future is going to be great
      - and that’s what being a spacefaring civilization is all about. It’s about 
      believing in the future and thinking that the future will be better than the past. 
      And I can’t think of anything more exciting than going out there and being among the stars.”
      -Elon Musk

    <p>SpaceX was founded in 2002 by Elon Musk. It is a privat American aerospace manufacturer and space transportation 
      services company. The goal is to enable colonization of mars, making humanity multiplanetary. The intention 
      would be for the first people to land on the Mars before 2030. SpaceX has plans for commercial rocket traffic 
      between the world’s major cities on earth. The rocket would be capable of traveling in less than an hour to anywhere on Earth, 
      with most trips taking about half an hour.
    <p>SpaceX offers comercial flights both Earth and lunar orbit with their <a href="shs.html">human spaceflight</a> opportunites.
      Orbital missons can be all from delivering cargo and supplies to the ISS to launch satellites into orbit. You can find
      planned SpaceX orbital missions on <a href="pom.html">Planned orbiltal missions page</a>.
      Space activity refers to human activity in space, which is generally defined as any activity over a distance of more than 
      100 kilometers from planet Earth.</p>
    <p>SpaceX has also plans to send three tourists to <a href="iss.html">the International Space Station</a> in late 2021. This wil be 
      a historic mission to make spaceflight possible for all people who has a dream to travel to space. The <a href="iss.html">ISS</a> 
      has been continuously occupied for over 20 years. Usually there are an international crew of six people at one time on the ISS. 
      <a href="wis.html">Who`s in Space </a>page you can follow who is in pace at this very moment, and on which craft he/she is on.
    </p>
    <p>One of the collaborators of SpaceX is NASA. Since 2012 SpaceX`s Dragon spacecraft has has delivered cargo to and 
      from the <a href="iss.html">ISS</a> multiple times, providing missions for NASA. NASA is is sending astronauts to the moon in 
      the 21st century, and has selected SpaceX`s Starship to achieve this mission.
